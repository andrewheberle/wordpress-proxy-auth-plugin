The WordPress Proxy Auth plugin helps developers/DevOps/admins easily implement authentication and authorization for WordPress by using the HTTP header fields provided by a reverse proxy.

== Description ==

The WordPress Proxy Auth plugin helps developers/DevOps/admins easily implement authentication and authorization for WordPress by using the HTTP header fields provided by a reverse proxy.

This could be employed to achieve SSO (OAUTH/OIDC and SAML) to a Cloud Identity Provider (e.g., Azure Active Directory, Okta, Auth0) by using an Identity-Aware Proxy, e.g., [Datawiza Access Broker](https://www.datawiza.com/access-broker) and [Google IAP](https://cloud.google.com/iap).

Note that the plugin requires a reverse proxy sitting in front of the WordPress site. The reverse proxy performs authentication, and passes the user name and role to the plugin via HTTP headers.

**How it works**

* The plugin retrieves the user id (email) from the HTTP header and then checks if such a user exists. If not, the plugin creates a new user by using this email and signs him/her in.
* The plugin retrieves the user role from the HTTP header and sets it as the user\'s role in WordPress.
* The HTTP headers for user id and role are HTTP_X_USER and HTTP_ROLE, respectively.

**!!! NOTES !!!**

* **MAKE SURE that clients cannot bypass the reverse proxy. This is to prevent people from sending forged malicious requests with arbitrary headers directly to WordPress.**
* **MAKE SURE that the reverse proxy in front of the WordPress site erases the incoming http request's HTTP_X_USER and HTTP_ROLE headers. These two headers should be generated by the reverse proxy only and then passed to the WordPress site. This prevents malicious clients from sending forged malicious requests by setting the headers with arbitrary value (e.g., setting HTTP_ROLE to Administrator), which would compromise the security.**
