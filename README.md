# wordpress-proxy-auth-plugin

The proxy-auth plugin helps developers/DevOps/admins easily implement authentication and authorization for WordPress by using the HTTP header fields provided by a reverse proxy. This could be employed to achieve SSO (SAML, OAUTH/ODIC) to a Cloud Identity Provider (e.g., Azure Active Directory, Okta, Auth0) by using an Identity-Aware Proxy, e.g., [Datawiza Access Broker](https://www.datawiza.com/access-broker) and [Google IAP](https://cloud.google.com/iap).
